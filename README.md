# Title of the Project
ENHANCING ROAD SAFETY THROUGH ROBUST LANE DETECTION USING COMPUTER VISION


# About
In recent years, the convergence of computer vision and transportation technologies has paved the way for significant advancements in road safety and autonomous driving systems. One critical component of these developments is the accurate detection of lane markings, essential for maintaining vehicle trajectory and ensuring safe navigation on roadways. This paper introduces a novel approach to "Enhancing Road Safety Through Robust Lane Detection Using Computer Vision." The accurate identification of lanes is a fundamental aspect of intelligent transportation systems, contributing to the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. Lane detection algorithms play a pivotal role in interpreting the road environment, providing crucial information for vehicle control and decision-making processes.
